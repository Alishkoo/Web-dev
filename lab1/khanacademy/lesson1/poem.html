    <h1>To Autumn</h1>
    <p>Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,<br>
        Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;<br>
     Conspiring with him how to load and bless<br>
        With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;<br>
     To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,<br>
        And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;<br>
           To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells<br>
        With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,<br>
     And still more, later flowers for the bees,<br>
     Until they think warm days will never cease,<br>
           For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.</p>
